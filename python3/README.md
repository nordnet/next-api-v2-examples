## Requirements
* There is no longer any test environment available. Contact Nordnet Trading Support to get started.
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
  [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.

## Install and run
1. Download the `nordnet/next-api-v2-examples` repo
2. Run and provide your username, password and the path to the Nordnet API public RSA key PEM format
   file as arguments. The PEM file is provided by Nordnet Trading Support during onboarding.
```
cd python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./test_program.py [insert username] [insert password] [insert pem key file path]
```
Running the test program should output something that looks similar to the following example output
```json
